#Chat Room

This is a chat room built in python.
Project for CS4119 Computer Networks


2 programs:
-server.py
-client.py

In order to run:

001   Run server.py first
        python server.py <port #>

002   Now run client.py
        python client.py



TEST


##server.py:

001    Reads list of username-password combinations from "user_pass.txt"
002    Listens on given port/waits for clients to connect
003    When client requests connection, server asks for username & password
004    If combination is correct, client logs in + display welcome message
       If combination is incorrect, allow 2 more failures (the number of failures should be mutable)
       If combination is still incorrect after 3 failures, block access for that specific user from the failed IP address
          for 60 seconds (60 seconds should be stored in variable "BLOCK_TIME" so that it can be easily changed)
005    After the user is logged in, the server should be able to recognize + respond to specific user commands.
        If the server cannot recognize some command, an error message should be displayed.

whoelse                                 Displays name of other connected users
wholasthr, wholastmin                   Displays name of only those users that connected within the last hour or minute
